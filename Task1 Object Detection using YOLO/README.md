# Object Detection using YOLOv3 and OpenCV on COCO Dataset

## Ahmed Mady, Computer Vision Intern, The Sparks Foundation

## In this repo, a trained YOLOv3 model on COCO Dataset is presented. This model classifies objects based on more than 60 classes of objects.
To be able to the the jupyter notebook, first download the h5 weight file from: https://drive.google.com/file/d/10xPcy598fQ6URpfAcrWYVpsv225ISdMZ/view?usp=sharing (yolo.h5)
and add it to the data folder. 

The folder images/test includes the test images, and the images/res contains all the resulting images after object detection.
