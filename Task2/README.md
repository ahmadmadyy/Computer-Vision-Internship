# Color Identification using ML and OpenCV

### Author: Ahmed Mady, Computer Vision Intern at The Sparks Foundation

### Machine Learning K Means algorithm is used to predict the colors found in an image.   The reason is that it does not require any specific training on a huge set of images. Another reason is that you can increase the number of clusters (and, thus, the number of colors), by choosing a smaller or higher amount of tones. Results are displayed on a pie chart inputting the maximum number of colors you desire, with the color converted to a hexadecimal format showing the RRGGBB sequence for easier referencing.
Language used: Python

# The test images are in images/test, and the pie chart results are stored in images/res.
